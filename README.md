# Modifications
If you want to modify the code or extend the usage beyond what is provided here then you will need to download the Source Code file. This project requires the "robin_stocks" library be added so that the Robinhood API can be accessed. This should be relatively simple to do with the command "pip install robin-stocks". You can visit the robin stocks github page here: https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks and the documentation here: https://robin-stocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
